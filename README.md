Theory

1. The variable parameters of the problem are the geometry, the values of Omega and Delta. We started with a 4x4 square lattice and the King's problem, where we used the geometric mean of the distance between two diagonally connected nodes and two nodes connected directly via the x-axis. Since the parameter $\Omega$ controls the laser intensity that performs the gate pulse, it has to start and end at zero. Using the relationship $$R_{a} = \frac{C_{6}}{\sqrt{\Omega^{2} + \Delta^{2}}}$$, and setting $\Omega(t_{f}) = 0$, we find that $\Delta$ is predetermined by the chosen Rydberg Radius. More quantitatively, it scales as $R_{a}^{-1/6}$. Thus, we see that increasing the Rydberg Radius will rapidly makes our initally chosen state a worse approximation of a true ground-state. For large enough Rydberg radii, this will hinder us from ending in a ground state at the end, by conservation of energy. We can see this, specifically, going from the King's radius to the $R_{b}/a = 3$ case yields terrible results, as our $\Delta$ goes down massively.
2. since we set the initial and the final value for the $\Omega$ equal to zero. $\Delta$ 

We started with the very basic case of the King's problem in a regular 4x4 grid with a 10% defect density to get. We remained in a square lattice and then increased our Rydberg radius to two times
